 *   Framework to demonstrate how you can write a Unit Tester for your Project
 *   - Not a requirement to use, but it may be helpful if you like.
 *   - This only has one example of a test case in it, so it is just to show how to write them.
 *
 *   This lets you test your egul_sched.c code WITHOUT any of the StrawHat code running.
 *
 *   Why run all tests every time instead of checking a function once to see that it works?
 *   - You could break existing code when adding a new feature.
 *   - Test files like this are useful to check all of the tests every time, so you can make sure
 *     you didn't break something that used to work when you add new code.
